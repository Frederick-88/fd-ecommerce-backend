## Backend of React-Ecommerce made with ExpressJS (NodeJS) & MongoDB, deployed to AWS

### Note :
### If you use heroku as your backend hosting's choice, everytime you want to commit use heroku's way :

- git add .
- git commit -am "make it better"
- git push heroku master
- with git push

### When set it up in cloudflare, you need to set the SSL till flexible. So your AWS Settings could come in.
